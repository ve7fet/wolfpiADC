# Wolf-Pi Custom Version

This is a fork of the original Adafuit ADS1015 Library, ported to Linux by sanjuruk.

The base library remains intact, but we're getting rid of the examples, substituting our own code for use in our project.

Our project uses the ADS1115, connected to a NanoPi Duo 2 via i2c, running Armbian.


# Driver: ADS1115 ADS1015 TLA2024 

Driver for TI's ADS1115(16-bit) ADS1015(12-bit) TLA2024(12-bit) Differential or Single-Ended ADC with PGA and Comparator.

## Forked for Linux

This is a modified version of the [Adafruit's ADS1015 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ADS1X15).
This library can be directly used through the i2c bus of a Single Board Computer using Linux like Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, pcDuino, Odroid etc.

1) Activate Linux i2c module on your board
    > raspi-config/armbian-config or other ways. Please review board specifications and Linux distro settings
2) Confirm the activated i2c device name
    > ls /dev/i2c*
3) Use this device in the constructor of the device you are using
    > TLA2024 tla_sigleEnded("/dev/i2c-0", 0x48);
   
4 examples are provided to highlight different uses of the library.
Example 'multiDeviceOnSameBus' added to show how to use 2 chips on the same bus. Max devices supported on the same bus are 3. Check the datasheet for more information.

## Build

Build the static library and the examples using the 'Makefile'
Go to the project folder and type <code>make</code>

To clean up, use <code>make mrproper</code>

## Hardware

This family of ADCs provide 4 single-ended or 2 differential channels.
Each has a programmable gain amplifier from 2/3 up to 16x. Available in 12 or 16 bit versions:
